## Scope

### "Meta" Definition Requirements

According to the definition of "Meta" on the [EA Post](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5FXFrCe2PvXBdQbTX/meta-charity-funders-what-you-need-to-know-when-applying) the following requirements must be met:

- "Meta organizations are those that operate one step removed from direct impact interventions."
- "These can focus on the infrastructure, evaluation, and strategic guidance necessary for the broader field to maximize effectiveness and impact."
- "They are essential in bridging gaps, identifying high-impact opportunities, and enabling other organizations to achieve or amplify their end-product impact."

### Alignment with Scope

GoalFlow is a tool designed to help organizations and individuals achieve their goals more effectively while saving them time and money. This helps them "achieve or amplify their end-product impact".

In this way it can be classified as an infrastructure project that falls in line with the definition of "Meta".

## Theory of Change

More that one theory of change model is needed. They can be broken down into the following categories:

- Simplistic Model
  - A basic model that summarizes how GoalFlow can help users achieve their impact goals.
- Detailed Models
  - A detailed model that details how specific features of GoalFlow can help users achieve their impact goals.
- Growth Model
  - A model that is used to help scale up GoalFlow.

### Simplistic Model

The basic theory of change for GoalFlow is the following:

Inputs:

- The features of GoalFlow

Outputs:

- The benefits of using GoalFlow for the problems it solves

Outcomes:

- Time savings
- Cost savings
- Increased productivity
- Enhanced efficiency
- Improved organizational alignment

Goals:

- Users are better able to achieve their impact goals

### Detailed Models

A detailed model is in development. Some information has been added to this model and will be updated.

You can access the model on the Impact Section of the [GoalFlow Landing Page](https://goalflow.io).

### Growth Model

The growth model is also in development. While GoalFlow is not yet at a point where it can be scaled up, the model is being developed with the intention of scaling up GoalFlow in the future.

The model will contain common growth strategies that can be used to scale up user adoption for most software products. It will then be a matter of determining the specific KPIs that can be used to measure the effectiveness of each strategy and the timelines.

My general plan will be to reach out to meta EA orgs to see if they are interested in using GoalFlow themeselves and work with them to find orgs that would be interested in using GoalFlow. At the same time I will be reaching out to other EA orgs to see if they would be interested in using GoalFlow directly. Additionally I will reach out to previous customers that I believe will adopt GoalFlow. Once early adopters have been secured I will begin marketing GoalFlow to the general public.

## Track Record

Due to GoalFlow being a new product in early development, there is no track record to speak of. What I can provide is my track record.

The summary of my track record is the following:

- I ran a successful software development and IT consulting business for almost 10 years giving me experience in:
  - Managing multiple clients simultaneously.
  - Managing stakeholders.
  - Managing a portfolio of projects, services, and products.
  - Managing a business and financial aspects of the business.
  - Marketing and sales.
  - Risk management.
  - Customer support.
  - Team management.
- Prior to that I worked as for a company for almost 8 years where I simultaneously fullfilled multiple roles doing project timekeeping, IT administration/support, and software development. This gave me experience in:
  - Project management.
  - Project timekeeping.
  - Technical support.
  - Software development.

These experiences have given me a strong understanding of the needs of users and the challenges they face. I've effectively acted as a CIO and CTO while being a managed IT Service Provider for my clients helping them get up and running with new technologies and helping them grow their businesses.

In order to accomplish the above I've had to work with a wide range of technologies and tools. This has given me a strong understanding of what works and what doesn't when working with software and IT.

I have even helped develop, integrate with, change, and improve significant portions of ERP systems for my clients.

In one instance I was tasked with merging two companies together alone. This involved merging their ERP systems together and integrating their software and databases together. This was a complex process that required a high level of attention to detail and a strong understanding of the software and databases involved. During this process I had to combine multiple data sources to develop business intelligence reports to help with the decision making process.

## Budget

The budget for GoalFlow during development is composed of the following:

| Category                 | Month | 6 Months | Year   |
| ------------------------ | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| Personal Living Expenses | $2500 | $15000   | $30000 |
| Business Administration  | $200  | $1200    | $2400  |
| Production Services      | $10   | $60      | $120   |
| Development Services     | $80   | $480     | $960   |
| Total                    | $2790 | $16740   | $33480 |

Depending on the timeline of development, the budget may need to be adjusted. I'm estimating that some of the earlier features released that can be used in productions may be released in beta in about 3 months and then fully released in about 6 months. From here the additional features will continue to be developed and released. Depending on the amount of users additional staff may eventuall be needed.

## Price Tag and Incremental Upscaling

As a single full-stack software developer I am able to develop GoalFlow without any additional overhead and the complications of managing multiple developers. This allows me to keep the costs down.

This is the reason why I am only asking for $15,000. It should easily be enough to get the project to a point where it can be released and used by a small number of users and validate it. From here if needed I can request additional funding if needed which supports incremental upscaling. If additional funding beyond the $15,000 is possible, it would further help me ensure my ability to continue development and maintain it.

## Sustainability

After getting GoalFlow into production I can begin serving it as a SaaS product. In this way I use the revenue to fund future development.

Due to the benefits of the software and existing demand for it I am confident that I will be able to continue development and maintain it.

## Strategic Alignment

To get a more detailed explanation of this section you can read [here](/content/docs/EA-Meta/06-why-now.md).

### "Why this?"

Many tools exists for different features and/or sets of features of GoalFlow. GoalFlow aims to be the one stop shop for all of these features. Using GoalFlow as a single tool to replace all of the traditional tools for most standard personal and org use cases already contains a significant amount of value. By adding in the additional features GoalFlow will become even more attractive.

### "Why now?"

The technology needed to develop GoalFlow's advanced features has only recently become available. I believe existing and competitors will eventually add these features. I have a chance to capture a significant portion of the market before this happens. At the same time since my primary focus is on the EA community this allows me to further contribute to the EA community by developing GoalFlow. Competitors are not as focused on the EA community and therefore will not develop features that are tailored to the needs of the EA community.

### "Why has no one been doing this before?"

Simply put that the technology has only recently become available. While there have been a variety of automation tools that have been developed there have been some significant issues preventing their widespread adoption.

- Many automation tools are not designed to be used by non-technical users.
- Many are designed for specific use cases and not general purpose.
- The cost of developing and maintaining these tools has been a barrier for individuals and small organizations.
- APIs for various existing products have been non-existent, lacking and/or expensive.

With the advancement of AI and the availability of APIs for a wide range of existing products GoalFlow becomes possible.
