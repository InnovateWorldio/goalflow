Welcome Meta Charity Funders!

The purpose of this site is to provide information about GoalFlow to potential funders.

I'll provide a quick overview of what each section is about.

## GoalFlow

This will explain the main purpose of GoalFlow and how I believe it will be beneficial to EA.

While GoalFlow might seem like just another app used to support a wide variety of common personal and business functions that other apps already support, it has the potential to be very powerful due to how it is being built.

One of the main benefits of GoalFlow is that it will be built as an open and extensible framework. This will allow anyone to easily add new features and use cases to the platform. This essentially means that the platform will be self-improving and can be used as an application builder.

## Use Cases

This section will provide a set of use cases that GoalFlow will support. It will explain how it can be used to solve a variety of problems individuals and organizations face.

Then I'll provide a list of ways that GoalFlow can be used to support Effective Altruism.

Finally I'll share some projects that I aim to build using GoalFlow.

## Funding

This section provides information about each aspect of the funding requirements mentioned on the EA Post.

I'll also add information for the budget and how it will be used.

## Plan

This will give a breakdown of the one year plan and 5 year plan for the project while also providing a timeline of when certain milestones will be reached.

## About Me

This will provide a brief overview of my background and experience.

I'll also provide some information about my motivations for building GoalFlow.

This information will help funders understand my capabilities and the level of commitment to the project.
