Welcome Meta Charity Funders!

The purpose of this site is to provide information about GoalFlow to potential funders.

I'll provide a quick overview of what each section is about.

### Warning

- I developed the Landing Page overnight the day before the application was due using a framework that I had never used before and using libraries that I had never used before.
- The current landing page is not the final design.
- I also did not have a resume prepared or updated LinkedIn profile. Previously I ran my own business and did not need these things as I had plenty of work.

## GoalFlow

This will explain the main purpose of GoalFlow and how I believe it will be beneficial to EA.

While GoalFlow might seem like just another app used to support a wide variety of common personal and business functions that other apps already support, it has the potential to be very powerful due to how it is being built.

One of the main benefits of GoalFlow is that it will be built with a flexible architecture. This will allow anyone to easily add new features and use cases to the platform. This essentially means that the platform will be self-improving and can be used as an application builder.

## Use Cases

This section will provide a set of use cases that GoalFlow will support that are relevant to Effective Altruism.

## Funding

This section provides information about each aspect of the funding requirements mentioned on the EA Post.

I'll also add information for the budget and how it will be used.

## Plan

This will give a breakdown of the one year plan and beyond for the project while also providing a timeline of when certain milestones will be reached.

## Why Now?

This section will provide a detailed explanation of why now is GoalFlow is needed, why now is the time to build it, and why it hasn't been built before.

## About Me

This will provide a brief overview of my background and experience.

I'll also provide some information about my motivations for building GoalFlow.

This information will help funders understand my capabilities and the level of commitment to the project.
