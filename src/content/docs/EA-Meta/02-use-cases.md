Due to the flexibility of GoalFlow, it can be used for a wide range of use cases beyond general administration and operations tasks.

Here are some of the potential use cases:

- X-Risk Risk Management Platform
  - Create a unified and collaborative risk registar
  - Perform AI supported risk analysis
  - Perform AI supported threat modeling and kill chain analysis
  - Incorporate scraping and monitoring of open source intelligence (OSINT)
  - Trigger automated responses to specific events and monitor for specific conditions
  - Create a centralized and collaborative knowledge base
- EA Project Collaboration Hub
  - Used as a unified directory for who is doing what
  - Allow the sharing of new ideas and projects
  - Collaborative impact analysis and feasibility of ideas
  - Possibly even include a funding platform. Could allow crowdfunding.
- Meta Charity Funders (or others) Funding Platform
  - Ideally the EA Project Collaboration Platform would be used for this but there might be a need for a separate platform for this purpose
- Research Automation Platform
  - Create a centralized and collaborative knowledge base
  - Connect to various data sources
  - Automate the collection, processing, and analysis of data
  - Trigger the generation of new ideas, hypotheses, and areas of research
- Policy Development Platform
  - Incorporate the Research Automation Platform as a sub-system
  - Use the information to create and update policy proposals
  - Use the AI Agents to simulate and analyze the potential impact of different policies
  - Use the AI Agents to help create, update, and optimize strategies for lobbying and advocacy
- Open Information Request Platform
  - Many governments allow for the public to submit requests for information under the right circumstances.
  - The governments have to spend money to respond to these requests, gather the information, prepare the information, and release it.
  - Due to this some governments attach fees to the requests.
  - This platform could be used to crowsource and crowdfund the payment of these fees.
  - It could also be used to aggregate requests to allow for more leverage when negotiating access to information.
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Platform
  - This could be used to aggregate and analyze open source intelligence (OSINT) from around the internet.
  - This could be used to create a real-time picture of events and issues as they happen.
  - This information could be used to support the other use cases or be used in additional use cases.
- General Risk Management Platform
  - The same processes used for X-Risk Risk Management Platform could be used for other types of risk management.
  - These could include supply chain risk, cybersecurity risk, bioweapons risk, etc.
