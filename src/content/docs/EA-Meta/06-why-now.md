## Summary

Why this project?

- There is a need for a tool to solve multiple problems that existing tools don't fully address

Why now?

- Other tools that will compete with GoalFlow are likely in development now but may not have the same amount of capabilities or be as cost effective for EA use cases

Why not before?

- The underlying technologies needed to make this tool effective were not available in the past

## Why this Project?

### Initial Motivation

Prior to the decison to develop GoalFlow I had a large set of potential EA and non-EA projects that I wanted to work on. A subset of these projects are listed in the use cases section.

Each project has the potential for a large impact, however I could only work on one project at a time and each project required a large time investment and carried a large amount of risk.

### Background Experiences with Multiple Tools

I had come up with the idea of GoalFlow in the past but mainly as an alternative productivity system to the many I had used in the past. Each of those systems had specific flaws that limited their usefulness for me so I would continue to switch and combine them to suit my needs.

Tools like Notion and Obsidian could be customized to help with a significant subset of the tasks that I had in mind, however I would still need to put significant time into customizing and maintaining them.

One of the closest tools I had found was ClickUp. It has a powerful combination of features to support a wide range of use cases.

- dashboards
- portfolio items (projects, products, services, initiatives, campaigns, etc.) management
- task management (lists)
- custom fields
- view management (boards, calendars, etc.)
- document management
- knowledge management
- CRM capabilities
- collaboration
- templates
- automations
- integrations
- eventually several AI capabilities

I found a lot of potential in ClickUp but it still didn't meet my needs.

One of its main drawbacks was that it was hard to query data between different lists. These essentially became silos that couldn't be used easily or at all. This quickly became a problem for me when I was managing multiple projects with many moving parts across multiple customers.

### Cost of Inefficiencies in my Business and for my Clients

During my time running my business doing Software Development and IT Consulting I got to interact with a variety of tools and systems across my clients and saw a recurring theme:

- Lack of a flexible data model
- Lack of an easy way to connect data between different systems
- Lack of a way to query, visualize, extract features, and integrate data into Business Intelligence dashboards
- Lack of apis
- Lack of a way to create custom workflows
- Many more issues

These issues led to a lot of silos and inefficiencies in my business and for my clients.

These issues came costs:

- Cost and time setting up multiple tools and systems
- Cost and time maintaining tools and systems
- Cost and time training staff to use tools and systems
- Cost and time getting data between systems
- Cost and time fixing issues that lead to data errors being created and propagated
- Cost and time creating reports and dashboards

### Detailed Analysis of Multiple Tools

I had previous experience helping my clients build, manage, use, and maintain multiple tools and systems covering the full range of what ERP systems provide. I even had to had a point where I had to help two clients go through a merger rapidly and alone as the only IT consultant due to one of the previous IT consultants being fired right as the merger was announced.

In order to do this I had to:

- Map all of the business processes to all of the underlying systems
- Map the inputs and outputs of each activity in each business process
- Map the data models of each system to the underlying database schemas
- Map the data types, value formats, validation, and business logic to the underlying database schemas
- Perform data analysis, data cleaning, feature extraction, and data transformations
- Create import/export scripts to move data between systems
- Create custom workflows to move data between systems
- Create reports and dashboards to visualize data
- Create and maintain documentation for all of the above
- Assist with user acceptance testing and training

Prior to doing this we reviewed other existing tools and systems and found that they were either lacking in one or more of the areas above, would be difficult to modify to fit our needs, or were too expensive for the level of functionality that they provided.

### The Need for a New Tool

Everything above led me to the conclusion that there was room for a new tool that could help solve all of these problems. The ideas of GoalFlow began to develop from this.

### Decision to Work on GoalFlow

Knowing that each project would require a large time investment and carry a large risk I decided to focus my energy on a single project that I was confident would have a large impact.

Several ideas seemed like they could meet those criteria. GoalFlow was one of them.

I had the idea of using other no-code tools, minimal code tools, and AI software generation tools to create multiple projects at once.

After testing a variety of these tools I found too many problems and then began to evaluate the idea of developing my own app generation tool.

I began prototyping various parts of what the overall system would require. While I had many successes, I found some issues that I wasn't sure how to solve.

At a point I began re-evaluating GoalFlow, and because of new information I learned working with AI systems and polymorphic data and development models, I realized that I had a much better idea of how to create a flexible and powerful system.

I could actually develop GoalFlow. Due to its structure and the power of incorporating AI Agents, I could use what I learned to not only develop GoalFlow for its original purpose but also as a tool to help develop other tools and other apps with.

## Why Now? Why hasn't this been built before?

### Case for Automation

The underlying logic for automation has pretty much always been around and is based on money:

- People, businesses, orgs, etc need money to operate and generally seek to obtain more money than needed to simply survive
- Reducing operational and administrative expenses is one of the main ways to net more money
- The general classification of these expenses are:
  - Labor
  - Equipment
  - Consumables
  - Materials
  - Third Party
- Reducing these operational cost is commonly done by:
  - Finding a cheaper alternative item
    - Includes outsourcing
  - Process changes to improve productivity
    - Includes automation
- It is generally easier to focus currently on reducing
  - Labor Cost
    - Especially in the current environment where many workers use software
  - Equipment Cost
    - Especially in the case of software

### Overview of Why AI Automation will change things and is different from previous automation methods

The summed up Logic for why AI Automation will change things:

- Traditional Software Automation solutions have had a lot of problems making them hard to implement (explained later)
- AI Automation has capabilities traditional software automation solutions don't have as well as more benefits (explained later)
- While these automations are first aimed towards general software they are expanding to also impact various forms of traditional labor work.

### Issues with historical automation methods

Before I move into the evidence about the impact of how I believe AI Automation is likely to be significantly different I need to cover a common automation objection.

Objection:

- If software can already be created to automate a variety of tasks, and it hasn't lead to major job losses, then why would AI automation be different?

First a clarification to this objection:

- 1. Software automation has led to job losses but those workers were able to find other jobs

Reasons:

- 1. Cost: Software Automation has generally been expensive to implement because it generally has required customized software development solutions to be developed for specific use cases
- 2. Scope: The custom automation solution isn't always able to be easily re-used outside of the specific use case it was created for as other situations where it might be used likely have different processes and tools with different configurations which the automation tool needs to be adjusted to work with
- 3. Flexibility: if existing processes, tools, or configurations change the automation will need to be adjusted which means more cost.
- 4. Dynamic Variables: there are often cases where an automation tool can't easily be programmed to easily deal with dynamic inputs
- 5. Limited APIs: A significant amount of software that exists doesn't have an API to use to interact with the software which means that you either have to hack your way into the software code, its database, and its files or find a way of automating clicks and inputs through the software's GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- 6. Decision Making: Often certain steps in a process need decisions to be made to determine what the next step should be. This decision might initiate multiple other processes outside an an existing solution that require more complex automation steps.
- 7. Time: It can take a lot of time to developed a customized automation solution.

So combining all of these factors with the constantly changing sets of software tools that are being developed, it is hard for customized software automation solutions to keep up.

Despite that software automation has been improving and growing without AI

- Existing software automation tools
  - have been adapted to more types of software
  - have had advances in capabilities
  - have improved access to APIs they need to interact with
- Software applications themselves
  - are often being updated to automate certain processes internally without the need for external automation tools
  - are often exposing APIs that the automation solutions can use

These same advances will actually benefit AI Automation and are.

### How AI Automation fixes these issues

How AI Automation fixes these issues:

- 1. Cost: For reasons mentioned below it is easier with recent AI technology to develop solutions cheaper
- 2. Scope: The AI automation tools are often able to extrapolate from a specific use case to other use cases
- 3. Flexibility: Because of their ability to generalize they are able to flexibly adjust to dynamic software environment changes.
- 4. Dynamic Variables: They generally are better at working with dynamic variables better by using tools to more easily work with the dynamic variables and decide the best tool to call.
- 5. Limited APIs: In the case where they need to work with the existing software they are better at quickly mapping out the architecture of the software and determining what functions to call. This is still more manual now but is increasing. Alternatively AI automation tools are better able to interact with GUIs and figure out what steps to take themselves when more complex situations arise.
- 6. Decision Making. They are often able to perform a variety of decision making tasks themselves and determine the next steps to take without having to be explicitly programmed in many use cases
- 7. Time: The time that it takes to implement these AI automation tools can be significantly faster than manually coding an automation tool.

### Objections and Responses

Objection:

- If AI automation tools already exist, why haven't they already lead to major job losses?

Response:

- The underlying technology that make them effective has only recently become available and it takes time to develop, test, and implement solutions.

Changes that just made this possible recently:

- Improved AI models that these AI solutions implement
- Improved Tool Calling capabilities have been added to LLMs that many of these systems rely on to give the LLM a task to perform and allow it to decide what tool to use for the given tasks and how to format the response in a way that the systems using these LLMs can use to perform the automatons
- Improved ways to create Agents that can be assigned to specific types of task to do and giving them the tools needed
- Improved workflows to managing and orchestrating the activities of multiple Agents

### Overview of the impact of AI Automation

Support for major job losses on a short timeline:

Automation from AI has the possibility (which I estimate is high) to impact a significant portion of most industries across the world. Many solutions have already been developed and are being rolled out. New ones are constantly being developed.

Below is an overview of the jobs I believe are likely to be impacted more significantly soon since it is already starting to happen in these areas.

Data related jobs

- Data collection: automating gathering data from a variety of sources
- Data entry: possibly impacting a significant chunk of Administration positions and general workers doing data entry tasks
- Customer Service: this has a lot of data entry aspects but involves looking up data relevant to a question and providing responses
- Data Analysis: used to interpret data to make predictions. This ranges from medical information to stock markets to detailed data science pipelines

Software Development

- Software Development: automating and enhancing a variety of software development tasks possibly building enterprise grade software solutions automatically soon
- This also includes things like documentation, testing, scaling services, code reviews, etc

Media Creation

- Images. Impacting many industries that need stock photos, custom images, art, etc
- Video. Same as above but impacting Hollywood, YouTube content Creators, etc
- Voice. Same as above but impacting voice actors, audiobooks, podcast, YouTube voiceovers
- Music. Same as above but impacting the music industry
- Articles. Same but for all text content Creators

Science

- Using combinations of the above significant chunks of automation can occur across wide chunks of the science research and development pipelines

Security

- Red Team. Automation of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities
- Blue Team. Automatically defending against exploits and patching vulnerabilities

Education.

- Many of the education processes can be automated and be used to dynamically adjust to the user in ways traditional teaching methods often fail at

And more.

My argument wasn't that automation of ask these jobs would happen at once. It takes time to develop, test and integrate these. But even with the current technologies today is already starting. With existing technologies a lot of this can occur. These are rapidly developing. I believe that within the next few years even based on existing technologies this automation will increase and lead to significant job losses

I believe in a short timeline because solutions are already starting to be rolled out now and are advancing rapidly. It still takes time for adoption which is why it will be a few years before it spreads more. I'm estimating 4 years for a wider adoption and within 10 years mass adoption. Around 4 years is where I believe the major job losses will occur which I believe will continue.

This could change due to a variety of variables associated with government responses, organizational policies, social acceptance, etc.

But there will likely be a strong push or businesses and orgs that to implement the automations to remain competitive. If other businesses out-compete them that are using the tools it means their death or being bought by another company.

How Software Automation generally works:

- Most people, businesses, orgs have a pretty standardized set of administration activities that they need to perform that would be commonly called administrative business functions.
- Most of these processes require software to perform the function and often requires many different applications to be used that results in a process like this
  - Get data from one system
  - Enter the data in another system
  - Do something with the data possibly using another system
- These processes are generally formalized as a set of step by step instructions for how to do each activity within the process
- Repetitive parts of each activity that consistently do things in the same way have a higher chance of being automated

So I have laid out my arguments and evidence for why I believe AI automation will be different than previous historical events.
