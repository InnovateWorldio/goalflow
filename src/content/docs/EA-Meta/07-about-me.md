## My Journey to Effective Altruism

I've considered myself an Effective Altruist before I ever heard the term. I've had a passion for wanting to make the world a better place for a long time, been skepitcal of the effectiveness of various solutions other claimed, and have been looking for ways I can contribute.

I believe that prior to hearing about Effective Altruism I consumed various related content such as:

- J-PAL Evaluating Social Programs
  - https://www.povertyactionlab.org/page/evaluating-social-programs
- J-PAL Designing and Running Randomized Evaluations
  - https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+JPAL102x+1T2017/home
- Social Norms, Social Change
  - https://agora.unicef.org/course/info.php?id=2351

These caputure only a small fraction of the content I've consumed but were critical in shaping my thinking.

In 2013 I completed a software development bootcamp named DevBootcamp in Chicago, IL and desired to start having an impact by trying to work for the following organizations:

- Center for Open Science: Improving scientific integrity and transparency
  - https://centerforopenscience.org/
- Sunlight Foundation: Making government and politics more accountable and transparent
  - https://sunlightfoundation.com/
- Code For America: Helping improve government services
  - https://www.codeforamerica.org/

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get hired despite putting in strong effort for the following reasons:

- Center for Open Science:
  - They wanted python experience but I had ruby on rails experience and despite my efforts trying to show that my ruby experience would transfer since the languages are similar I wasn't given the opportunity.
- Sunlight Foundation:
  - They were looking for someone with more experience and a degree.
- Code For America:
  - Due to there being a significant amount of applicants they do a lottery system for applications and I didn't win.

I decided to move back to Houston, Texas shortly after and start my own business doing software development. I reached out to my previous employer I did IT and Project Cost Controls for and they were happy to be my first client. Work grown quickly and I picked up many clients. I ended up doing more IT consulting than software development and wanted to make a change.

At some point, I believe around 2015, I came across the term Effective Altruism while I was researching various ethical frameworks and came across an article associated with Peter Singer. I was immediately hooked and started reading everything I could find on the subject.

In 2017 I attended my first EA Global in San Francisco. It was an amazing experience to meet like minded individuals and hear about all of the amazing work they were doing.

Around 2018 I ran the local EA Houston meetup for a short while. After a period I realized it might not be the best use of my time and stepped down. Part of that was from not having enough free time due to being overloaded with work.

I began preparing to make a change and shut down my business but in order to give myself a comfortable runway and gradually transition my clients, I continued for several more years.

## My Transition to my Status Today

At the end of October 2021 I finally closed down my business and moved to Lisbon, Portugal.

I took a bit of a break to explore Europe and recover from the last few years and begin teaching myself many of the newer software development frameworks and technologies.

During this time I helped work on developing an EA VR community. I ended up attending EAGX Prague in 2022 and EAG Berlin in 2023. In Berlin I hosted an EA VR Experience letting people interact with other EA members around the world. I made many friends, learned a lot, had a lot of fun, and get feedback on several EA focused software projects I had in mind.

Over this time AI developments exploded and I decided to learn as much as I could about it. I began working with multiple AI models and tools and came to the conclusion that I could increase the likelihood of having a positive impact by using AI systems to support EA Meta (infrastructure) Causes.

Since then I've been working on determining the best ways I can use my skills to help EA using AI systems.

I was born in Pennsylvania but only lived there until I was 5 and then moved to Beaumont, TX. After turning 18 I moved to Houston, TX.
